			<h2>What is Solid waste management?</h2>
			<p>Solid waste management refers to the systematic control, collection, transportation, processing, recycling, and disposal of solid waste generated by human activities. Solid waste encompasses a wide range of materials, including household garbage, industrial waste, construction and demolition debris, agricultural residues, and more. Effective solid waste management is crucial for environmental protection and public health. The process typically involves waste reduction at the source, proper segregation, recycling of materials where possible, and environmentally responsible disposal of remaining waste. It also includes strategies to minimize the environmental impact of waste, such as the promotion of composting, waste-to-energy technologies, and the development of sustainable practices. Governments, municipalities, and communities worldwide implement solid waste management systems to address the challenges associated with the increasing volumes of waste generated in urban and rural areas.</p>

			<h2>Government protocols</h2>
			<p>Governments implement crucial protocols in solid waste management to ensure effective environmental protection and public health. These measures typically involve the enforcement of waste segregation at the source, the establishment of organized waste collection systems, and regulations governing proper waste disposal, including guidelines for landfills and treatment facilities. Recycling initiatives, hazardous waste management protocols, and the promotion of waste-to-energy technologies are also common strategies. Additionally, extended producer responsibility programs hold manufacturers accountable for the life cycle of their products. Public awareness campaigns and legislative frameworks contribute to fostering a responsible waste management culture, aligning with global efforts toward sustainable development and a cleaner, healthier environment.</p>
